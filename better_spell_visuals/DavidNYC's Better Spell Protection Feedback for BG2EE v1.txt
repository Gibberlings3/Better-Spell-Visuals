    Absolute Immunity
    ProMissiles

    Disable Ioun Stone animations so as not to conflict with these

Probably set all these animations in a single go. (NB there is a bit of a conflict between SR's "Storm Shield" and SCS/IWD's "Storm Shell." Both can coexist, but it seems like they should be collapsed into one spell. I will probably handle this separately in my own mod, though.)

I know you have this geared toward SR+SCS, but at least some of these could be independent. I'll think about how much effort it's worth to support non-SR games.

Component 2: 'Varying Color Glows & Pulses'

I see what you're doing here, but I'm not sure how extensive this needs to be. I might leave it aside until I have wrapped my head around the extent of it.

Component 3: 'Bubb's Mirror Image Transparancy'

EEex-only, so broken out into its own component so players without EEex don't need to worry about it. In an effort to avoid using READLN, I would probably just offer a couple optional SUBCOMPONENTs, with 51% transparency and 80% transparency, or something like that.

Component 4: 'DavidNYC's Functional Tweaks'

Nondetection:

    Prevent Nondetection from stacking
    Nondetection add 206 vs. True Sight, Detect Illusion, and Faerie Fire
    Set power level of Nondetection so it can be removed by MAGICATTACKs
    Make Nondetection dispellable
    Set MSD spellstates for Nondetection

Dispelling Screen

    Set Dispelling Screen to SPELLPROTECTIONS sectype
    Set Breach/Dispel Magic to 321 remove Dispelling Screen
    Fix dispel-on-hit items to work with this version

Fire Shield/Acxid Sheath:

    Set to SPECIFICPROTECTIONS sectype



DavidNYC's Better Spell Protection Feedback for BG2EE v1 (March 2021)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Everyone has permission to use these files and animations. If you publish a Baldur's Gate mod which incorporates them, please give me a credit for posterity's sake.




//===========================================================================================


1. The following assumes SCS + Spell Revisions (v4 Beta 16) + Item Revisions (v4 Beta 10)


2. In some cases SR or SCS already applies a spell animation and I'm replacing it with a more transparent, toned-down animation that is less overwhelming among multiple protections. In other cases I'm applying an animation to a spell that doesn't have one.


e.g. Spell Shield is spwi519.spl. It aleady has an animation in DW#W519A.spl, which I replace. You won't have DW#W519A.spl unless you've installed SCS.

e.g. pfMW is spwi611.spl and does NOT have an animation, so you can add it directly in spwi611.spl. But this animation won't turn invisible when the mage goes invisible. You'll have to incorporate SCS' animation invisibility code to generate dw#w611a.spl, dw#w611b.spl, dw#w611a.eff, dw#w611b.eff, etc.

For simplicity I'm ignoring the animation invisibilty issue here. I have it all working based off SCS's method, but be aware there are a few tweaks to certain invisibility spells, and detection spells, to get it working 100%.


3. I have Weidu functions that are very near copies of their original. If you see something like DK_DELETE_EFFECT, it's my tweaked version of DELETE_EFFECT. There are a couple of things my functions do that the original cannot, but I suspect they don't come up in these snippets. Fyi, I've pulled and edited these snippets from my code without checking them independently.

If trying to use my DK_CLONE_EFFECT as is below, just add the following RET variable to your DEFINE_PATCH_FUNCTION CLONE_EFFECT:

 	  // new_fx is # of new effects added. This variable already exists in the function.
   RET new_fx    


4. Varying Color Glows & Pulses as an additional spell 'animation'. This is a completely separate topic from SPELLPROTECTIONS animations. I currently use a pulsing purple glow on Silenced targets, and a pulsing white/blue glow on Blinded targets. See 'Varying Color Glows & Pulses' below.

// Mirror Image
//---------------------------------------------
Included in the files is an EEex fix created by modder Bubb on the Beamdog forum. It's a simple update to your Balur.exe that lets you set your mirror image transparency. I find this incredibly useful since I hate the visual on my PC's with 8 opaque mirror images.

The mod will prompt you for a transparency from 1 (fully visible) to 100 (invisible) IIRC and don't have this reversed. There's a problem where values less than 50 do not seem to work at all, but values >=51 work. We'd have to ask Bubb if this could be fixed, but the 51% option is great as is.




/**********************************************************
'Varying Color Glows & Pulses' 
**********************************************************/


Color pulses are far more limited than animations since they don't visually stack. A Silence glow will visually override a Blindess glow, and vice versa. But they're a handy visual clue for certain disabling effects where you can live with the risk of stacking. Note there's no alternative to using Full Body (location 255) if you're going to apply this to monsters as well as humans.

I slightly prefer opcode 8 (static glow) to opocde 9 (pulse glow) because the former can be a little easier to detect in a chaotic combat. But opcode 9 has the advantage that, by very slightly varying the pulse speed, you can uniquely identify each different pulse with opcode 337 Remove Effect.

e.g.	Silence, moderate speed full body pulse, 0x002800ff 
			Blindness, moderate speed full body pulse, 0x002700ff
			
Then in Vocalize, you can remove the Silence glow effect without removing the Blindness glow (or any other glow like Chant, or whatever). 

COPY_EXISTING ~spwi219.spl~ ~override~ 
	LPF DK_CLONE_EFFECT INT_VAR match_opcode=48 opcode=337 parameter1=0x002800ff parameter2=9 END


This is useful since some spells apply Blindness along with other effects. If you're using (e.g.) SR's Cure Disease to remove Blindness, you don't want to remove all spell effects with opcode #321 'Remove Effects specified by Resource'. You just want to remove the blindess effects.
